### **Phase 1: Extract Raw Data from Video**

- **Audio Extraction**: Pull audio track for transcription
- **Frame Sampling**: Extract frames at regular intervals (every 1-2 seconds)
- **Metadata Collection**: Duration, resolution, basic video properties

### **Phase 2: Generate Analysis Data**

- **Transcription**: Audio → text using Hugging Face speech recognition
- **Visual Analysis**: Frames → scene descriptions, activity levels
- **Temporal Mapping**: Align transcript with video timestamps

### **Phase 3: Content Scoring & Selection**

- **Prompt Analysis**: Parse "find funny moments" into scoring criteria
- **Content Scoring**: Rate segments for humor, engagement, relevance
- **Clip Boundary Detection**: Identify natural start/stop points

## Key Decision Points for Your Architecture

### **Processing Strategy**

- **Sequential vs Parallel**: Process audio/visual simultaneously or in stages?
- **Chunking**: Break long videos into smaller segments for API efficiency?
- **Caching**: Store raw analysis in `video_analysis_cache` to avoid re-processing?

### **Hugging Face Model Selection**

- **Transcription**: Whisper models for audio-to-text
- **Visual Understanding**: Models that can describe video content/scenes
- **Text Analysis**: Models to interpret your user prompts and score relevance

### **Content Identification Strategy**

For "find funny moments," you'd need to:

- Identify conversational patterns (setup/punchline structures)
- Detect laughter in audio
- Look for visual cues (facial expressions, reactions)
- Score transcript segments for humor keywords/patterns

## Questions to Consider

1. **Granularity**: How small should your analysis segments be? (1 second? 5 seconds?)
2. **API Efficiency**: Batch multiple requests or process individually?
3. **Scoring Approach**: Rule-based scoring vs AI-based relevance scoring?
4. **Memory Management**: Process entire video at once or stream through segments?
